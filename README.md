This is a classic ceasar cipher created using ruby.  You can run this in your console with $ ruby ceasar.rb

What this program does:

The ceasar cipher was used by Julius Ceasar to code his messages that he sent to generals on the battlefield.  His simple technique took each letter he wrote and replaced it with a different letter that was a certain number of letters away in the alphabet.

This program will ask you for a word or phrase and a number to create the cipher.  It will then return your coded message, retaining all capitalization and punctuation.
